Project Overview

Problem Statement: You are going to help AI and Computer Vision Communities by developing a Captcha Recognition  system. You design and train your model, then test it. Your system should be able to get a CAPTCHA, and then show its contents/characters as a text string. 

Components + Metrics + Grade Breakdown (Total 25%)
- Contents, Approach, Deployment: Make it as clear as possible (10%)
- Poster Quality: Clear and conveys the key project achievements well to the reader (2%)
- Q&A: Ability to thoroughly explain project process and considerations (5%)
- Curiosity, Exploration: Demonstration of deep understanding of the method's mechanisms instead of only achieving high-accuracy results (5%)
- Creativity: Novelty in the proposed solution (3%)

Core expectations:
1. Prepare the given dataset. (data cleaning, visualization, pre-processing, data 
normalization, tokenization, etc) [This is important!!] The Dataset could be a bit dirty. 
2. Minimally, develop a vanilla baseline character or string recognition system.
3. Provide improvements for the baseline method.
- Show the methods you chose to improve the baseline classification performance
- Explain how your method(s) works
- Why you choose this approach? Why it works or why it does not work.
4. Show empirical observations. (Plot learning curves, recognition scores, numerical results)
5. Present your work CLEARLY and nicely.

Data
- 3 directories: Train and Test for training and testing your models. Main directory comprises all 10000 images.
- The file name suggests the contents of the Captcha, ending with “-0.png”
- If you manage to find any dirty data sample, just remove it.
- If you manage to find any mismatch between the captcha contents and the file name, correct the file name.
- Use your test set for validation too.
- Report the metrics after training and testing both. 
- Does the dataset need any filtering and pruning?

Other key points:
- Preferred evaluation metric: Recognition Accuracy, Precision, and Recall
- You may find tokenization useful. It means that you may need to separate characters and recognize them individually (*) How to separate characters in a Captcha image? Do we need to normalize the characters?
- Using LLMs to recognize Captchas is not allowed. 

Bonus: 
- Develop a generative model to generate new Captchas.
- You may train your generative model using all the Captchas available in the Main directory.
- Then, you may test your Captcha generator using your Captcha Recognition model.
- Bonus will be up to 4% extra total score, but the ceiling will still be 25% for the project.
